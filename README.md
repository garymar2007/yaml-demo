YAML: Yet Another Markup Language
Tutorial vidoe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA90BTozdow

1. Not mark-up language

   ```
   - data format, used to exchange data between systems
   - similar to XML or JSON
   - In yaml file, you can only store data but not commands
   ```
   
2. Data serialisation

   Object --> Stream --> System(web, db, ML model, etc.) --> Stream --> Object
   |---------Serialisation---------|                |------Deserialisation----|
   ```
   - data serialization languages, such as YMAL, JSON, XML, etc.
   - configuration files, such as docker or k8s, etc.
   - logs & caches, etc.
   ```
   
3. Benefits

   ```
   - simple & easy to read: human-readable
   - easy to write but strict syntax: identation matters
   - supports comments
   - supports complex data structures
   - Easily convertable to Json or XML
   - widely used in many applications and frameworks
   - supports multiple data types (strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries)
   - supports references and anchors
   - supports custom data types
   - supports multiple documents in a single file
   - more powerful when representing complgex data structures
   - parsers available in many programming languages
   - parsing is easy and fast
   ```
